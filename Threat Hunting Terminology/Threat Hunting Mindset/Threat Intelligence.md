# Threat Hunting Mindset: Threat Intelligence

Threat Intelligence is data on threats. 

The data can be IP addresses, netblocks, domains, MD5 hashes, etc. 
The threats can be APTs, cybercrime groups, hacktivists, etc. 

Threat Intelligence can be divided into 3 types:
1. Strategic: Who, Why, and Where
2. Tactical: What and When
3. Operational: How

### 1. Strategic: Who, Why, and Where
Strategic Intelligence is designed to assist senior management in making informed decisions about the security budget and security strategists (such as risk management).

Anser the following:
Who is the adversary?
Why are they targeting you?
Where have they attacked prior to attaching you? 

### 2. Tactical: What & When
Deals with the adversary's TTPs; this is where the Cyber Kill Chain are used to attempt to identify the adversary's pattern of attacks, also known as their signature. 

Address the:
What is the adversary's toolset?
When are these attacks orchestrated?

### Operational: How
Deals with the actual indicators, the IOCs, and it addresses the how. 
How is the adversary conducting their attack? 

ISACs are one of several avenues to assist with obtaining this subset of intelligence. 
ISACs are Information Sharing and Analysis Centers.
