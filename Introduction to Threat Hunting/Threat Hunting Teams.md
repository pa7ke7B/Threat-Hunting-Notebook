# Threat Hunting Teams

The three most commonly encountered types are:
- Ad-hoc hunter
- Analyst and hunter
- Dedicated hunting team

## Ad-hoc Hunter
Usually responsible for multiple roles in the organization, and therefore the hunts occur less frequently. 

The hunts are more task-oriented, which requires a clear plan of what to hunt for on a given hunting trip. 

## Analyst and Hunter
Most common type of hunter. SOC analysts also have the responsibility to perform hunting. 

## Dedicated Hunting Team
Most specialized one - a team of a few members whose sole purpose is to hunt.
