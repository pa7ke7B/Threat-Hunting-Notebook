# What is Threat Hunting? 

## Notes
Threat Hunting is the human-centric process of proactively searching data and discovering cyber threats. 

- How do we know what to search for?

It is a different approach than waiting for an IDS/IPS to trigger something. 

Purpose is to reduce the dwell time by identifying threats in a very early stage of the infection, in doing so preventing attackers from gaining a stonger foothold and removing them from the network. 

The hunting process begins by identifying potentially targeted systems or data and categorizing which behavioral techniques the attackers may use. 

The hunte then attempts to locate and confirm abnormal activity. 

Threat intelligence is utilized during the hunt to develop techniques and carry out necessary actions to protect systems from compromise. 

### Hunting:

- Is an offensive-based strategy
- Requires the hunter to think like an attacker
- Requires strong practical understanding of cyber threats and the cyber-kill chain
- requires you to know your environment
- is easier with quality data and resources
