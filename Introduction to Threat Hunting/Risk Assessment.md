# Risk Assessments

**What is a risk assessment?**
The process of assessing threats, vulnerabilities, and their likelihood of occuring to the organization's assets. 

A risk assessment report will list all the vital systems/processes and the impact to the organization, if anything would happen to these systems. 

This report provides the hunter with an idea as to what systems/processes an intruder would most likely go after. 

With a risk assessment report, a hunter can determine where his/her focus should be; this means that no vital systems would be overlooked, because resources will not be wasted focusing on a less vital system or process. 

In large corps, it is not the job of the hunter to conduct the risk assessments.
