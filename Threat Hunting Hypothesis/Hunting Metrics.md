# Hunting Metrics

Hunting metrics are a way to track progress and report back to management about the hunting expeditions. 

Some things that hunters should show in regards to the work we perform: 
- how oftern we hunt
- technique coverage of ATT&CK
- procedure coverage of certain groups relevant for your type of business
- hunting coverage of the network
- historic logging capability that facilitates our hunts (how far back can we go)
